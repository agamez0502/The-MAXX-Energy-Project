# **MAXX Energy — Enterprise Data Access Portal**  
*Simulated Internship Project • DevOps Team Lead*

## 🌟 Overview
The **MAXX Energy Enterprise Data Access Portal** is an internal site built during my MAXX Potential Simulated Internship. The goal was to create a centralized space for employees to access company data, documentation, and internal resources through a clean, scalable WordPress design.

This repository includes:
- ✔️ UI screenshots of every page I built  
- ✔️ XML exports of all WordPress pages  
- ✔️ Starter code provided for training  
- ✔️ My documentation, notes, and page planning artifacts
